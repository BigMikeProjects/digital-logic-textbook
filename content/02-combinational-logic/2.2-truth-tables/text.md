# Truth Tables: Mapping Inputs to Outputs

A **truth table** is the fundamental tool for describing the behavior of any digital circuit. It exhaustively lists every possible input combination and the corresponding output.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, we'll explore:

1. **Reading Truth Tables** — How to interpret input/output relationships
2. **Building Truth Tables** — Creating tables from circuit descriptions
3. **Truth Tables to Circuits** — Deriving logic expressions from tables

## Why Truth Tables Matter

Truth tables provide:

- A **complete specification** of circuit behavior
- The foundation for **Boolean algebra** simplification
- A bridge between **problem description** and **implementation**

## The Basic Format

For a circuit with $n$ inputs, the truth table has $2^n$ rows:

| Inputs | Outputs |
|--------|---------|
| All 0s | Result |
| ...    | ...    |
| All 1s | Result |
