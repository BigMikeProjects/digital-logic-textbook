# Logic Gates: Building Blocks of Digital Circuits

Welcome to the section on **logic gates** — the fundamental building blocks of all digital systems.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, we'll explore:

1. **Basic Gates** — AND, OR, NOT, and their truth tables
2. **Universal Gates** — NAND and NOR, and why they're special
3. **Compound Gates** — XOR, XNOR, and their applications

## Why Logic Gates Matter

Every digital device — from simple calculators to powerful processors — is built from combinations of logic gates. Understanding these basic components gives you the foundation to:

- Analyze existing digital circuits
- Design your own combinational logic
- Understand how computers perform arithmetic and make decisions

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, you should be comfortable with:

- Binary number representation (0s and 1s)
- Basic Boolean algebra concepts
